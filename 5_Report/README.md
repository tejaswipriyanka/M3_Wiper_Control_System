# INTRODUCTION
- A windshield wiper or wiper blade is a tool that's used to do away with rain, snow, ice, washing machine fluid, water, from a vehicle's front window.
- Each heavy motor vehicles such as cars, trucks , train locomotives and some aircraftâ€”are hooked up with such wipers.
- After reading several research papers , I understood that protection requirements under detrimental weather situation is necessary even at low pace also for motor automobiles and therefore I began making wiper manipulate system the usage of arm primarily based microcontrollers
- It consist of rubber blades attached at its metallic fingers with pivot magnets at its other ends.
- Ultimately this challenge utility enables customers in daily lifestyles and forestalls injuries and allows secure and healthful adventure.

## RESEARCH
This utility is researched from diverse resources (such as you tube , google and studies papers ) after which i've changed into a success working model utility of wiper control system the usage of arm based totally microcontrollers

## END GOAL
- Clear vision in negative climate conditions.
- Avoid accidents and ensure safety with latest mechanism.

### Who
- Anybody who desires protection and clean vision of road in driving the usage of motor automobiles.
### What
- Wiper control system for motor vehicles.
### Why
- Curious about provider in embedded system 
### When
- Whilist you recognize the importance of protection management and begin to be responsible for your health during using motor automobiles in adverse weather conditions.
### Where
- This could be used by the user in everyday existence wherein they can track their protection and generate better results in existence at some stage in travelling through motor automobiles .
### How
- LED suggests the placement of wiper and it will return to the authentic function after cleaning windsheet of motor motors
